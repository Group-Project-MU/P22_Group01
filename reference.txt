Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content.
Text summarization is usually implemented by natural language processing methods, designed to locate the most informative sentences in a given document.
There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: extraction and abstraction.
Visual content can be summarized using computer vision algorithms.
Video summarization algorithms identify and extract from the original video content the most important frames (key-frames), and/or the most important video segments (key-shots), normally in a temporally ordered fashion.
Extraction-based summarization extracts content from the original data, but the extracted content is not modified in any way.
Abstractive-based summarization methods generate new text that did not exist in the original text.
Summarization systems are able to create both query relevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs.
The most common way to evaluate the informativeness of automatic summaries is to compare them with human-made model summaries.
The most common way to evaluate summaries is ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).
